CODEBASE STUFF
- Understand the codebase. Comment stuff, change variable and object names to be more specific... 'make it make sense'.
- Bug fixes if there are any, duh



But, otherwise, what else?
- The metadata table in the GUI should allow you to copy the cells more intuitively.
  As of now, you can click the cell and then press CTRL+C, but we should make it such that:
        - You do it in a right click menu
        - Make them 'text edit fields that don't allow you to edit anything' so people can highlight the text inside and copy it there.

- Importing more image formats than PNGs (imports. not exports. for exports, png is perfection)

- Batch exports/extracts
  Which means allowing the user to select multiple files in the file tree, and then giving the user a different set of options because you're hovering over many files rather than one.
  For some asinine reason, the entire thing is hardcoded to only allow you to select one file.
  So doing this will force me to refactor some stuffs :(

- Better auto-detection of all the farcs that a blurayguid wants to use
  Obviously we can't do this perfectly, but we can try. if a blurayguids.map doesn't already specify a location for the farc, try recursive searching. Ask the user in the configs first though.

- Bookmarks bar
  Profiles but less cluttered I guess. Gonna need some hefty UI work though!

- Mod Creation Wizard
  Want to make a simple mod, like a single sticker or music or IntMusic or sound or decoration or object or (non-shader) material?
  Well, here ya go! I'll be a lot of work though (but really nice for the user. Less fiddling and tedium)

- CONSIDER: Help Menus?
  Like, help icons in each menu, as as to make things easier

- CONSIDER: Translations?
  I don't want to actually translate stuff, but I would not mind having the support for it, if nothing else.

- 3D models in the viewport
  Currently experimental and Windows-only, but you should finish it.
  If not, at least have some way to generate a static preview of the object so the user known what the heck they're looking at?
  This is especially crucial for models. For levels, just yoink the icon image and then use a level badge image for a mask; the user should (hopefully!) know what's what.
  PS. We can export gltf, so if we, say, had a gltf-compatible 3D rendering library...
